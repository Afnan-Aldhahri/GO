# How GO related to our class : Software Engineering

As we studied at the beginning of the Software Engineering class ,

Software life cycle in general consist of these main steps: 

* Feasibility; Development of a Business Plan

* Requirements Analysis and Specification

* Design

* Implementation and Integration

* Operation and Maintenance

The software engineers start writing the code according to the client's requirements in the **Implementation** step .

and here comes the importance of  **programming languages** .

There is no **one perfect** programming language that guarantee to solve any problem.

The software developer has to choose the right programming language for that specific problem.

There are a lot of programming languages out there .However , I choose GO for [these](https://github.com/Afnan-Aldhahri/GO/blob/master/Resources/Why%20GO.md) reasons ,

And to make the topic even related to what we were studying in our class, I tried to focus on [Concurrency](https://github.com/Afnan-Aldhahri/GO/blob/master/Resources/Concurrency.md) feature of Go

because as we study in the class, Concurrent programming is always difficult since it require to implement correct access to shared variables.

Go support different ways in which shared values are passed around on channels and, so, never shared by separate threads of execution.

Only one goroutine has access to the value at any given time. Data races cannot occur.
