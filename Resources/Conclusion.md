# Conclusion

I am a *new* to GO world. My first time dealing with GO was when I start working on this presentation.

However, I found GO a very *fun* programming language .

Its easy to write ,and easy to read especially if you are familiar with C style programming languages.

Moreover, its very easy to learn . There are so many  documents on the Internet : specification, tutorial, "Effective Go" and a lot more .

What I really like about GO is two things :

**First** , its supporting for concurrency ,especially after studying concurrency the hard way in the class :)

Although I found *Channels* are a little bit difficult .However, *goroutines* are simple and straightforward .

**Second** , that GO is an open source environment .

If you want to help , create , build tools ,libraries ..etc , you are totally welcome.


*Finally*, if you liked GO , you can practice it by working on challenging programming problems from Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net/)
