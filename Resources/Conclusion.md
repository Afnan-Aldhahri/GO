I am a new to GO .My first time dealing with GO was when I start working on this presentation .

Howvere, I found GO a very fun programming languge .

Its easy to learn, easy to write ,and easy to read espicialy if you are familer with C style programming languages.

What I really like about GO,especially after we study concerrncy the hard way in the class, is its supporting fr concurrency .

Although I found Channels are a little bit diffuclt .Howevre, goroutines are simple and stright forwad .

Finally, if you liked GO , you can practice it by working on challenging programming problems from Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net/)
