AS 1 & 2 define GO : 

GO ,also known as golang ,is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build 

simple, reliable, and efficient software.

It is a statically typed language with syntax loosely derived from that of C, adding garbage collection,

type safety, some dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types such as variable-length arrays & key-value maps, 

and a large standard library.
