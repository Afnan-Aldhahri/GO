#Why GO ?

1-	**Young** : 

released in October of 2009. 


2-	**Simple** :

 I found GO an easy programming language because GO is a C-Like Syntax which means if you used 
 
 to work with C-like languages such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript and C#, then you’re going to find Go a piece of cake .
 
3-	**Concurrent** :

After lecture 8,9,and 10 in our Software Engineering class , we all know how much the concurrency is important. 

With a language that supports concurrency , a programmer don’t need to think about the hard concurrency(low level ).

he can just use the libraries and functions that support concurrency.

4-	**Garbage-collected** 

As we studied in programming class , its hard to determine the lifetime of a  some variable who referenced by other variables .

Languages with garbage collectors, like Go, are able to keep track of these varibles and removed them from the memoery when they’re no longer used .

5- **Fast** 

6-most important thing , its **Fun ☺**
