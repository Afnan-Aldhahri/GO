if you used to work with C-like languages such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript and C#, 
then youâ€™re going to find Go a piece of cake .

However, learning new language always need paitent untill you become familer with its properties and idioms .

Go [offical website](https://github.com/Afnan-Aldhahri/GO/blob/master/bibliography.md) has a long details documents that describe GO properties and idioms in details.
you at least need weeks to cover it .
So,In this section , I summerize that document and i choose for you the **basic properties** of GO that you need to write an effective GO code 
,and some advanced properties like **conucurrency** to make it related to what we study this semester .
