# GO

If you are new to **GO** , this presentation will give you an overview picture of **GO** and how its related to software Engineering .

After you finish reading this repository , you will be able to write , complie ,run , test an effictive GO code.

and most importantly , you will know why choosing GO .

We will start *together* this journey, since **GO** is a *new* programming language for me too.
